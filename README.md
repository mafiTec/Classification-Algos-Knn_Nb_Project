# Naive-Bayes-classification-algorithm-project
Biomechanical Features of Orthopedic PatientsÂ¶ In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal

3 Section I : Accessing the Data

Make a pandas DataFrame from the CSV
How many variables does the dataset contain?
What is the data about?
What are we trying to predict here?

#Section II : Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform some descriptive statistics and make a note of your findings
Plot appropriate graphs to understand the relation between the variables.
Point out any observations and comment on the strength of the relationships if any.

# Section III : Prepare data for Training!

Make a new column symptom_class with the abnormal rows as 1 and the normal rows as 0, drop the class column
Split the entire dataset into independent features and symptoms as the response variable
Normalize the variables.

# Section IV : Training with KNN

 train_test_split from sklearn and split the parameters and classes into train and test sets
Starting with three nearest neighbours , train your KNN model and make a note of accuracy and other diagnostics for both training and test sets.
Try with increasing the k value and check if there is any improvement in model performance. Use different value to arrive at the optimal value of k.
Evaluate your final model using appropriate metrics for classification and comment on them.

# Section V : Training with Naive Bayes

 fit a Naive Bayes Classifier to the same data.
Train a NB model with default arguments and make a note of training and test metrics
What are your inferences on the relative performance between the KNN and NB based models?
Which of these models would you recommend and with what reasons ?
